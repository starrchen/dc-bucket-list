# To Do

- [x] Create API for bucket list items
- [x] Get API data on page with angular
- [ ] Filter data by parameters (date, price, alphabetical, etc.)
- [ ] Deploy to Heroku
- [ ] $locationProvider (remove `#` from URL)
- [ ] Complete all seeds (currently: 18/50 entries, most incomplete)
- [ ] Add styling ([Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) / [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/))

## Filters

- [x] Default: Displays all (names only) in alphabetical order
- [x] Click "Free" button, only displays items where `price: "Free"` is true?
- [x] Click "Not free" button, only displays items where `price: "Free"` not true?
> Working but not ideal so:
- [ ] Get filters off HTML and into JS files

- [x] Second set of filter buttons working, "Show all" still working
> Multiple filters possible in HTML but still ideal...

### Filters
- [x] Free/not free
- [ ] Plan ahead/spontaneous
- [ ] District proper/ MD-VA
- [ ]

## Users
- [ ] User authentication
- [ ] Checked/unchecked items (~favorites feature - user must be logged in to check/uncheck)
- [ ] User authorization on checked/unchecked (users have unique checked/unchecked that only they can change)
