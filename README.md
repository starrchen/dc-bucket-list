# The Great Washington Bucket List App
An interactive app designed around [Washingtonian's Great Washington Bucket List (GWBL)](http://www.washingtonian.com/blogs/getaways/the-great-washington-bucket-list/50-things-every-local-needs-to-do)

## About
In March 2015, the Washingtonian published the [Great Washington Bucket List](http://www.washingtonian.com/blogs/getaways/the-great-washington-bucket-list/50-things-every-local-needs-to-do), a list of 50 activities that every DC local would regret not doing if they moved away. DC offers so much to residents and tourists alike, and it isn't right that locals miss out on so much that the District has to offer for fear of doing something too "touristy".

While the list provides a great launching point for folks to explore DC, it previously existed only as an article with a list of links to individual articles corresponding to each bucket list item.

Enter **The GWBL App**, which is designed to allow users to sort and filter the 50 items on the bucket list by helpful parameters like:
* How much will this cost? Is it free to do?
* Can I go whenever or do I need reservations?
* Is this place metro-accessible or do I need to find a ride?

As the app is developed, there will be more helpful parameters to let tourists and locals alike better plan their exploration of our nation's capital.
